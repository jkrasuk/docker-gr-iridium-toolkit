A Docker image to use the [gr-iridium](https://github.com/muccc/gr-iridium) and [iridium-toolkit](https://github.com/muccc/iridium-toolkit) software from the [Chaos Computer Club MÃ¼nchen](https://muc.ccc.de/) to parse ACARS messages on the Iridium network.

It is possible to send ACARS and map data to [TBG](https://thebaldgeek.github.io) by performing the following steps:
1. Set the `ACARS_ADDITIONAL_OUTPUTS` variable in `docker-compose.yaml` to include "udp:thebaldgeek.net:XXXX". Contact him to get the port number.
2. Set the `LIVEMAP_TO_TBG` variable to true.
3. Specify the port to which you will send the satellite beam data `TBG_SATS_PORT`.
4. Set the ICAO code of your nearby airport `AIRPORT_ICAO_CODE`.


This was made using Kevin's [script to manage MUCCC Iridium Toolkit](https://gist.github.com/kevinelliott/8bfbcc5555624082f743a7620322ee5c) and Rajan's docker image to wrap it.

Under active development, everything is subject to change without notice.

irdm.conf has details of your SDR device. Full details can be found [here](https://github.com/muccc/gr-iridium?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-file). This file must be in the same folder where the yaml file is located. 

An example for using an RTL-SDR with max gain and bias-tee enabled:

```
[osmosdr-source]
sample_rate=2500000
center_freq=1625600000

# Uncomment to use the RTL-SDR's Bias Tee if available
device_args='rtl=0,bias=1'

# Automatic bandwidth
bandwidth=0

# LNA gain
gain=49.6
```

Airspy R2 example:

```
[osmosdr-source]

# Uncomment the following line to turn on the antenna bias
device_args='airspy=0,bias=1,pack=1'

sample_rate=10000000
center_freq=1622000000
bandwidth=10000000

# Linearity Gain
gain=18
```
